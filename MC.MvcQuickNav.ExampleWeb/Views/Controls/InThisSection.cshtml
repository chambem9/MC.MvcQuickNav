<code>@@Html.InThisSection()</code>

<p>If we imagine that our website divided into a series of main sections, each one represented by 
    one of the top level items on the menu above, then the InThisSection navigation control shows us 
    links to the other items in this section.
    You can see one to the left of this page.</p>
<p>It it easier to appreciate with more levels of navigation, so take a look at the 
    @Html.ActionLink("Examples section", "index", "demo").
</p>

<p>You can render an In This Section control by calling its HTML helper:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/chambem9/4984254.js"></script>

<p>Which will output something like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/chambem9/4985123.js"></script>

<p>Apply some CSS, for exmaple:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/chambem9/4985094.js"></script>

<p>And you'll see something like this:</p>

@Html.InThisSection()

<p>(As we mentioned above, this makes more sense with a deeper navigation tree - see the
    @Html.ActionLink("examples", "", "demo").
</p>

<p>As with the Navigation Menu control, you can pass the maximum depth as a parameter to have it render only down to this depth.</p>
